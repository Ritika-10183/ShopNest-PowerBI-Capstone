ðŸš€ Power BI Project: ShopNest Store - Comprehensive Analysis ðŸ“Š

I recently completed an insightful Power BI project for ShopNest Store, focusing on Order Level, Product Level, and Customer Level analysis. Here are the key highlights of my analysis:

Order Level Analysis:

Identified the rating distribution across categories like Excellent, Very Good, Good, Bad, and Very Bad, providing a clear picture of customer satisfaction.
Analyzed the total number of active sellers yearly and monthly to track engagement and growth.
Created a dynamic visual to compare delayed orders versus those received on time, leveraging drill-through and cross-report features for detailed insights.
Product Level Analysis:

Ranked the top 10 and bottom 18 most popular product categories based on the number of orders, helping to identify customer preferences.
Analyzed profit margins across various product categories using a custom formula to determine product profitability.
Excluded certain cities from analysis to categorize sellers based on their locations, offering insights into regional sales patterns.
Customer Level Analysis:

Assessed the preferred payment methods among ShopNest customers, with a special focus on credit card payments made monthly.
Identified key trends in customer behavior, providing a deeper understanding of payment preferences and engagement.
This project has enhanced my ability to derive actionable insights from complex data, using the power of interactive dashboards and visualizations. Looking forward to applying these skills in future data-driven projects! ðŸŒŸ
